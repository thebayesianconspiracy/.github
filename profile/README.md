# The Bayesian Conspiracy

### Who are we?

We're The Bayesian Conspiracy. We were many different people at many different points of time, going by many different collective names. We're friends from IIT Kharagpur, currently in different parts of the world. We love science, we love programming and we love hackathons. We believe, as many people do, that technology is magic. `The Bayesian Conspiracy` has won (some award) in over 20 hackathons itâ€™s been to. We want to spread our love for building prototypes!
